Welcome to hisse!

This is an R package for understanding diversification processes in various ways.

It has multiple models: 

* HiSSE: for binary traits with or without hidden states, to better model heterogeneity of the diversification process
* GeoHiSSE: for geographic models where species can be in more than one area at a time
* MuHiSSE: for multiple states (or multiple characters converted into a single multistate character)
* MiSSE: trait-independent heterogeneous models

This is the bleeding edge version: you can install it with `remotes::install_github("thej022214/hisse")` [install the remotes package from CRAN first]

See http://thej022214.github.io/hisse/ for info on its functions and its vignettes (longer tutorials, listed as articles).
